These are the code files for the book "Beginning Perl" 
by Curtis "Ovid" Poe.
 
 
Chapters 1 and 2 do not have any code files.
Every other chapter does. Every directory 
has a readme.txt file that explains how to 
run the code in the  directory. 
 
Any dependencies that need to be installed from
the CPAN are also listed. 
 
Note that some of the code examples differ 
slightly from the book. Mainly, this is to 
print useful messages to explain the code 
if you don't remember what was in the book,
or to explain useful error messages if the 
code is called incorrectly. 
 
If there are confusing issues in the code, 
there are often comments to explain what's going on.  
Otherwise, please consult the relevant chapter for
the book to understand what's going on.
