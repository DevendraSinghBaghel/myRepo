Yarn Data Flow
================

1) When we submit an application the yarn client will communicate with the service Resource Manager(RM)
   which is part of yarn and runs in the master node, it manages the Resources.

2)RM is only process tht has the fullview of the Resource Utilization in the Cluster

3)Scheduler runs inside RM and it Schedules the applications based on Certain Rules

4) ON the slave nodes yarn runs a process called Node Manager(NM)

5) NM will monitor the Compute Container in the Node and will updates it status to the RM Periodically

6) if RM does not receive the status from a NM for long time then it will consider that as dead and will not use it.

7)  Apllication Manager(AM) is the part of RM which starts the Apllication Master( AMa) in the NM

8) AMa start the application tasks in containers and the resources are allocated to the containers

9) THe containers can take 2GB of Memory

10) The RM will send a list of free nodes to AMa on which the applications tasks are executed

11) This architecture make it possible to run multiple applications on Yarn
