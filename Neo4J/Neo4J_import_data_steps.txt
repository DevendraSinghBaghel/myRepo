LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///neo4j_module_datasets/test.csv" AS line 

-root node info: n is the root node(type MyNode) with attribute name taken form the Source columns in the csv 
MERGE (n:MyNode {Name:line.Source})

-target node info: m is the target node (type MyNode) with attribute name taken form the Target columns in the csv

-edge info will be label To and has a property dist taken form the distance columns in the csv
MERGE (n) -[:TO {dist:line.distance}]-> (m)
