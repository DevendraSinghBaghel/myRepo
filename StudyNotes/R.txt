You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. Have a look at this example:

some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")

elect the first and the fifth day of the week: use the vector c(1, 5) between the square brackets. 
For example, the code below selects the first and fifth element of poker_vector:

poker_vector[c(1, 5)]

poker_vector[2:4]. Notice how the vector 2:4 is placed between the square brackets to select element 2 up to 4.

you can also use the element names to select multiple elements, for example:

poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday")]

by putting selection_vector between the square brackets that follow poker_vector:

poker_vector[selection_vector]

Matrix
=======

In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. 
Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.

You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:

matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

In the matrix() function:

The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix. Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.
