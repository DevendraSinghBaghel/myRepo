DeepLearning
==============

-DeepLearning uses very powerful NNs for predictions

-DeepLearning facilitates interactions between different input features 

-Inputlayer,Hiddenlayer,Outputlayer are three different layers in a NN

-more nodes in the Hiddenlayer will facilitates the NN to capture more interactions between
 input

- The firing of a NN classifier, or activation as its commonly called, produces a score.

-A neural net can be viewed as the result of spinning classifiers together in a layered web.
 This is because each node in the hidden and output layers has its own classifier.
 
- A set of inputs is passed to the first hidden layer,
  the activations from that layer are passed to the next layer and so on,
  until you reach the output layer,where the results of the classification are determined by the scores at each node.
  This happens for each set of inputs.
  
- This series of events starting from the input where each activation is sent to the next layer, and then the next, all the way to the output,
  is known as forward propagation, or forward prop.Forward prop is a neural net's way of classifying a set of inputs.

- Each node has the same classifier, and none of them fire randomly;
  if you repeat an input, you get the same output.
  So if every node in the hidden layer received the same input,
  why didn’t they all fire out the same value?
  The reason is that each set of inputs is modified by unique weights and biases.
  
-You may have guessed that the prediction accuracy of a neural net depends on its weights and biases.
We want that accuracy to be high,
meaning we want the neural net to predict a value that is as close to the actual output as possible,
every single time.
The process of improving a neural net’s accuracy is called training

- to train the net, the output from forward prop is compared to the output that is known to be correct,
and the cost is the difference of the two.
The point of training is to make that cost as small as possible, across millions of training examples.
To do this, the net tweaks the weights and biases step by step
until the prediction closely matches the correct output.
Once trained well, a neural net has the potential to make accurate predictions each time.

- let’s say that a net had to decide whether or not an image contained a human face. A
deep net would first use edges to detect different parts of the face – the lips, nose, eyes,
ears, and so on – and would then combine the results together to form the whole face.
This important feature – using simpler patterns as building blocks to detect complex patterns
