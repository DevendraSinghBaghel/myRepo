DeepLearning
==============

-DeepLearning uses very powerful NNs for predictions

-DeepLearning facilitates interactions between different input features 

-Inputlayer,Hiddenlayer,Outputlayer are three different layers in a NN

-more nodes in the Hiddenlayer will facilitates the NN to capture more interactions between
 input
