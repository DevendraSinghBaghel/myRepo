Hadoop
==========
Data Flow
------------
- Client takes to YARN Resource Manager, notify about the intent to start a MR Job
- YARN Resource Manager knows which node can be made available for the job
- At the same time the client copies all the needed data for the MR Job into HDFS
- MR Application Master kicks off under a NodeManager
- Anything that is running a MR job is managed by a NodeManager
- Application Master laison with YARN Resource Manager and distributes the 
  job onto different nodes under different NodeManager 
- The Nodes running different tasks under the MRJob, talks with the 
  HDFS to obtain the needed data
- YARN Resource Manager tries to schedule the job in a node that is closer to the data
- YARN Resource Manager can restart the Application Master if it goes down
- Application master monitors and restart all the worker tasks , if any tasks fail.
- Application master restart a task preferably on a different node.
