There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These include Monospace, Serif and Sans-Serif

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
}
