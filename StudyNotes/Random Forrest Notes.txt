Random Forrest
==============

An example
-----------

Suppose we have five data points in our training set.
We'll call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
For the first tree, we'll randomly
pick five data points randomly sampled with replacement.
So the data could be 2, 4, 5, 2, and 1.
Each time we pick one of the five data
points regardless of whether or not it's been selected already.
These would be the five data points
we would use when constructing the first CART tree.
Then we repeat this process for the second tree.
This time the data set might be 3, 5, 1, 5, and 2.
And we would use this data when building the second CART tree.
Then we would repeat this process
for each additional tree we want to create.
So since each tree sees a different set of variables
and a different set of data, we get
what's called a forest of many different trees.


Just like CART, random forests has some parameter values
that need to be selected.
The first is the minimum number of observations in a subset,
or the minbucket parameter from CART.
When we create a random forest in R,
this will be called nodesize.
A smaller value of nodesize, which leads to bigger trees,
may take longer in R.
