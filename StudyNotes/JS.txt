Anonymous function
===================
var diff = function  ( a, b) {
}; -> new style loads only when this line of code is reached ,

call like diff ( a,b)
console.log(diff) - return the function body returned

function test1 ( a, b) {
} old style,loads when the prgm loads

map function example
=====================

var res = numbers.map ( function (arraycell) {
			return arraycell *2;
}

);

The specific list of “falsy” values in JavaScript is as follows:

-"" (empty string)
-0, -0, NaN (invalid number)
-null, undefined
-false

- The difference between == and === is usually characterized that ==checks for value equality and === checks for both value and typeequality. 
 However, this is inaccurate. The proper way to characterizethem is that == checks for value equality with coercion allowed, 
 and=== checks for value equality without allowing coercion; === isoften called “strict equality” for this reason.
- for enforcing more stricter coding in JS use "use strict"

var x = function bar(){
    // ..
}; ---- function expersion
