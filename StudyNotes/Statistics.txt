we'll look at the relationship
between variables.
This is an association.
It can be a trend that is a positive association
or negative association or it can be a pattern.
It could be any discernible shape.
It could be linear or non-linear.

Pearson product moment correlation coefficient
===============================================

Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, rho,
measures the linear association between variables X and Y.
It's based on standard units measured
in terms of standard deviation and it ranges from minus 1
to positive 1.Now a rho value of 1 indicates a scatter
that is a perfect straight line sloping up.
A rho value of negative 1 is a scatter plot
where it's a perfect straight line sloping down.
Rho 0 means that there's no linear association.
X and Y are uncorrelated.

Rho is defined as the average of the product of X in standard units
and Y in standard units.
That measures how clustered the scatter
is around a straight line.

 some additional properties of rho.
It's a pure number with no units,
and it's not affected by changing
the units of measurement.
It's also not affected by switching the X and Y-axes.
