#The Data consists of Customer data for the company CENet,
#first col is customer id next 12 cols are there bill value

#load the data

#Mapper
#For data chunk i we compute via the map function 
#the i-th group sum s_1i, s_2i,...,s_5i and the 
#corresponding group sizes: n_1i,n_2i,...,n_5i. 
#The map function therefore returns key-value pairs (k,{n_ki, s_ki}),
#where k is the group label (1,2,â€¦,5), n_ki is the number of data rows in k-th
#group, while s_ki is the sum of all the data rows from the k-th group.

  key=factor(ag[,1]);
  keyval(key,split(ag[,-1],key))

#Reduce
#The REDUCE part computes the final sums of the data rows 
#for each group and returns the key-value pairs (k,{n_ki, s_ki}) 
#for the whole dataset

#Map-reduce
#Once we have defined the map and reduce function 
#we compute the groups sums with mapreduce.
